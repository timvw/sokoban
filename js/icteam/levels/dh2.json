Some of the puzzles are very, or\nslightly, symmetrical as a stylistic device (in this I am influenced\nby David W. Skinner's excellent Sasquatch puzzle sets at his Sokoban\npage). Others are completely unsymmetrical and the style is in the\nvariations alone.\n  ","Email":"david@clickfest88.freeserve.co.uk","Url":"http://www.clickfest88.freeserve.co.uk","LevelCollection":{"Copyright":"David Holland","MaxWidth":20,"MaxHeight":19,"Level":[{"Id":"Egg","Width":17,"Height":19,"L":["      #####","     #     #","    #  # #  #","   #  #   #  #","   # #  *  # #","  #  # * * #  #"," #  ##$.#.$##  #","#  # $  #  $ #  #","# # *  *.* .* # #","#  $ ##. .## $  #","# # *. *.*  * # #","#  # $  #  $ #  #"," #  ##$.#.$##  #","  #  # * * #  #","   # #  *  # #","   #  # @ #  #","    #  # #  #","     #     #","      #####"]},{"Id":"Square version 3","Width":12,"Height":13,"L":["      #####","      #   #","####### # #","#    $ $ $#","# # ..... #","#  $.$$$.$#","### .@# . #","  #$.$$$.$##","  # .....  #","  #$ $ $   #","  # # ######","  #   #","  #####"]},{"Id":"clover version 4","Width":11,"Height":11,"L":[" #### ####","##  ###  ##","#    #  . #","#   * *   #","## * $ * ##"," ## *@* ##","## * * * ##","#   * *   #","#    #    #","##  ###  ##"," #### ####"]},{"Id":"prefab #5","Width":20,"Height":15,"L":["          ####","       ####  ######","       #  # .##   #","       #  $  #  # #"," #######.*.**#$## #"," #        #     # ##","## ##$##### $  $#  #","#  # . *  ####  ## #","# ##$* *$ #   #  # #","# #  .....$@$    # #","# #   ##  ######## #","# ##  ##  #        #","#  ######## ########","##          #"," ############"]},{"Id":"Figure eight","Width":15,"Height":12,"L":[" #####   #####"," #   #####   #","##     *     ##","# **##$.$##** #","#  . # * # .  #","# ** #$.$# ** #","##   # . #   ##"," ### ## ## ###","  #  ## ##  #","  #    $    #","  #### @ ####","     #####"]},{"Id":"Skewsymmetric pattern #6","Width":17,"Height":17,"L":["         #####","      ####   #","   ####    # #","####  $ # $  ##","#   .#.$.$.$. #","# # $.$.$.$.# #","#  $.$.$.#.$.$##","##  $.#.$.$.$  #"," # #.$.$ $.$.# #"," #  $.$.$.#.$  ##"," ##$.$.#.$.$.$  #","  # #.$.$.$.$ # #","  # .$.$.$.#.   #","  ##  $ # $  ####","   # #  @ ####","   #   ####","   #####"]},{"Id":"Butterfly #3","Width":15,"Height":13,"L":["###############","#   #     #   #","#  . * *@*  . #","##$##  *$ ##$##","#    #   # $  #","#  #*#####.#  #","# $* #   # .$ #","##   #*.$#   ##"," ###     * ###"," #  . * * $. #"," # ## ###.## #"," #    # #    #"," ###### ######"]},{"Id":"Crossed Swords version 10","Width":20,"Height":17,"L":[" ##### #####","##   ###   ######","#  #  ##      $ ##","# $$   ##*###  $ ##","#  # $ #...  #  $ ##","# $# # # *$# ##  $ #","#    $ #...#   #$  #","##  #####.## $    ##","# .#...##.### ##  #","# *.*....*.. $#####","# .#. .##.### #####","## # ####.#       #","## $  ###*#$#$$ $ #","#  ##   $@$    ## #","# $ $ #$### # $   #","#     #     ##    #","###################"]},{"Id":"interlocked goals","Width":16,"Height":12,"L":["#########","#   #   ####","#    * ..$ #","###$## # $ ##","  #  $  #  @##","  ##   .###  ###","   ####    # $ #","      #$.#*    #","     ## * . ####","     # $.*.##","     #     #","     #######"]},{"Id":"Meshed Squares","Width":15,"Height":9,"L":[" ############","### .*.*.$  ##","#   * $ * $  ##","#  $.$.*.*.$  #","# $ * *@* * $ #","#  $.*.*.$.$  #","##  $ * $ *   #"," ##  $.*.*. ###","  ###########"]}]}}}
