{"SokobanLevels":{"xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","xsi:schemaLocation":"SokobanLev.xsd","Title":"The cantrip collection","Description":"Author&apos;s note: The puzzles are all small &amp;&#35;40;between 6 and 9 goals andpretty cramped&amp;&#35;41;, with maze and walls designed by me andcomputer-generated start positions. Because of the computerinvolvement, the start positions of the puzzles may look abstract orrandom. The meat of the puzzles is in the variations, the unexpectedtwists, and the underlying problems. The human element of design ismost evident in the solved position, by construction, and I like tothink of the solving process as producing order from chaos. Thiscollection is meant for experienced solvers, or at least determinedones, as it contains probably my toughest puzzles so far. As usual Ihave tried to put the puzzles in rough ascending order of difficulty,but here this is even more approximate than usual as I find thepuzzles difficult to compare. The puzzles have been extensivelyplay-tested. On a good day I can actually solve them...","Email":"david@clickfest88.freeserve.co.uk","Url":"http://www.clickfest88.freeserve.co.uk","LevelCollection":{"Copyright":"David Holland","MaxWidth":12,"MaxHeight":10,"Level":[{"Id":"loom1","Width":10,"Height":7,"L":["&amp;#35;####","&amp;#35;##   ###","&amp;#35; $ # * #","&amp;#35;# $*.*  #","&amp;#35;  *   . #","&amp;#35;@  ###  #","&amp;#35;#### ####"]},{"Id":"pinwheel3","Width":10,"Height":9,"L":["&amp;#35;###","&amp;#35;  ######","&amp;#35;   $@$ #","&amp;#35; **##. #","&amp;#35;#$.$  . #","&amp;#35;  .# .*##","&amp;#35;    $  #","&amp;#35;#####  #","&amp;#35;###"]},{"Id":"fretsaw1","Width":10,"Height":9,"L":["&amp;#35;#########","&amp;#35;@ *.##  #","&amp;#35; $   $  #","&amp;#35;##*..#  #","&amp;#35;  $  ##","&amp;#35; .#. #","&amp;#35; $ $ #","&amp;#35;###  #","&amp;#35;###"]},{"Id":"canine4","Width":9,"Height":10,"L":["&amp;#35;####","&amp;#35;   #####","&amp;#35; # $ $ #","&amp;#35; $$. *@#","&amp;#35; #  ** #","&amp;#35; ### *##","&amp;#35;  # .* #","&amp;#35;#  . . #","&amp;#35;#     #","&amp;#35;######"]},{"Id":"notchwheel1","Width":10,"Height":9,"L":["&amp;#35;###","&amp;#35;####  #","&amp;#35;# $  $ #","&amp;#35;@$.#.* ##","&amp;#35; $.$ .  #","&amp;#35;#$.*#.  #","&amp;#35;      ##","&amp;#35;  ######","&amp;#35;###"]},{"Id":"quarkspin3","Width":11,"Height":8,"L":["&amp;#35;###","&amp;#35;##  #####","&amp;#35;  .$  . ##","&amp;#35; $*@#$*  #","&amp;#35;# .$* .  #","&amp;#35;## #  ###","&amp;#35;   ##","&amp;#35;####"]},{"Id":"osmosis1","Width":10,"Height":9,"L":["&amp;#35;#########","&amp;#35;   #    #","&amp;#35; #$. .# #","&amp;#35;@#. * # #","&amp;#35; # * .# #","&amp;#35; #*$*$# #","&amp;#35; $      #","&amp;#35;###  ####","&amp;#35;###"]},{"Id":"catkins5","Width":10,"Height":9,"L":["&amp;#35;####","&amp;#35;#   #####","&amp;#35;  # $@$ #","&amp;#35; #..#*  #","&amp;#35;  .   . #","&amp;#35;# $.#.* #","&amp;#35; $ $$# #","&amp;#35;####   #","&amp;#35;####"]},{"Id":"splittee1","Width":9,"Height":9,"L":["&amp;#35;######","&amp;#35;#  #  ##","&amp;#35;     $ #","&amp;#35; ** **@#","&amp;#35; * # * #","&amp;#35;#  .  ##","&amp;#35;  .$##","&amp;#35;#   #","&amp;#35;####"]},{"Id":"flagon1","Width":11,"Height":9,"L":["&amp;#35;#######","&amp;#35;   #  #","&amp;#35;#$#   .##","&amp;#35;# .* #   #","&amp;#35;  .* *$# #","&amp;#35;   . #@$ #","&amp;#35;  # ##$###","&amp;#35;###    #","&amp;#35;#####"]},{"Id":"shuffle1","Width":9,"Height":8,"L":["&amp;#35;####","&amp;#35;##   #","&amp;#35;##..$. #","&amp;#35; $ $.$##","&amp;#35; #$. * #","&amp;#35;  . *$ #","&amp;#35;#   # @#","&amp;#35;#######"]},{"Id":"bigt2","Width":10,"Height":9,"L":["&amp;#35;####","&amp;#35;   ####","&amp;#35; #$   ###","&amp;#35; #.*$*  #","&amp;#35; # .* # #","&amp;#35;  . $.#@#","&amp;#35;##  $ # #","&amp;#35;###   #","&amp;#35;####"]},{"Id":"gyroscope2","Width":9,"Height":9,"L":["&amp;#35;####","&amp;#35;##   ###","&amp;#35; $ #$  #","&amp;#35; ....* #","&amp;#35;  *. $ #","&amp;#35;# # # ##","&amp;#35; $$* #","&amp;#35;# @ ##","&amp;#35;####"]},{"Id":"moebius2","Width":9,"Height":8,"L":["&amp;#35;###","&amp;#35;#  ####","&amp;#35; $  $ #","&amp;#35; $... ##","&amp;#35;@*$$$* #","&amp;#35;# ...  #","&amp;#35;#   ###","&amp;#35;####"]},{"Id":"boomerang5","Width":10,"Height":10,"L":["&amp;#35;###","&amp;#35;##  #","&amp;#35;@$ .#####","&amp;#35; *$ $ $ #","&amp;#35;# * * . #","&amp;#35; . . ###","&amp;#35; . ###","&amp;#35;# $#","&amp;#35;  #","&amp;#35;###"]},{"Id":"clasp1","Width":11,"Height":10,"L":["&amp;#35;####","&amp;#35;#####   #","&amp;#35;   # $  #","&amp;#35;#  $..#$ #","&amp;#35;  #**.   #","&amp;#35;@# *.*#  #","&amp;#35;   ##   ##","&amp;#35;## $  ###","&amp;#35;##  #","&amp;#35;###"]},{"Id":"heart4","Width":11,"Height":9,"L":["&amp;#35;###   ####","&amp;#35;  #####  #","&amp;#35;    $@$  #","&amp;#35; *.$#*.* #","&amp;#35;# . # . ##","&amp;#35; . #$. #","&amp;#35;# $$  ##","&amp;#35;  #  #","&amp;#35;######"]},{"Id":"cossack2","Width":10,"Height":8,"L":["&amp;#35;###","&amp;#35;####  ##","&amp;#35;   $ $ ##","&amp;#35;   #.$. #","&amp;#35;#  **.#@#","&amp;#35;   . $ #","&amp;#35;####  ##","&amp;#35;###"]},{"Id":"space invader1","Width":9,"Height":8,"L":["&amp;#35;####","&amp;#35;##   #","&amp;#35;# .$.$#","&amp;#35;  .** ##","&amp;#35; * . * #","&amp;#35;#   $$ #","&amp;#35;  ## @#","&amp;#35;#######"]},{"Id":"bola1","Width":12,"Height":10,"L":["&amp;#35;####","&amp;#35;   #####","&amp;#35;     $@#","&amp;#35;# ##.#*###","&amp;#35;## # $  $ #","&amp;#35; $ .$. .# #","&amp;#35;   $ ##$# #","&amp;#35;##.#.  .  #","&amp;#35;   ######","&amp;#35;####"]}]}}}
